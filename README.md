# Un-Supervised-Machine-Learning
Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables.

The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data.

Clustering, Dimension Reduction, and Association are the three major types of tasks that are performed by Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms.
